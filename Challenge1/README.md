# NDAX.io: A Case Study

## Overview and Origin

NDAX Inc. is a Canadian-based cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2018. It is headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. The exchange currently lists over 30 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Cardano and Tether. Its vision is to provide a secure and regulated platform for Canadians to participate in the cryptocurrency market.

The company was founded by Bilal Hammoud, CEO and VP Technology Development. Bilal has a background in finance and software technology. Before founding NDAX, he worked as a consultant for various financial institutions, helping them to develop their digital platforms. He saw an opportunity to create a secure and regulated cryptocurrency exchange that would address concerns specific to Canadian investors.

Hammoud and his partners were motivated by the lack of regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in Canada. They wanted to create a platform that would allow Canadians to participate in the cryptocurrency market without the risks associated with unregulated exchanges.

NDAX is a privately held company, and therefore information about its ownership structure and principal investors is not publicly available. However, a search of crunchbase.com https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/ndax-pre-seed--4906f6dd reveals that NDAX received a pre-seed funding round of $1.5M in January 2018. Crunchbase listed the pre-money valuation of the company at that time as $5M.  Information about later funding rounds is not available.

## Landscape

This company operates in the Blockchain/Cryptocurrency space.

Major trends and innovations over the past 5-10 years TODO


The competitive landscape for cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide is constantly evolving, with both domestic and foreign players vying for market share. Some of the notable competitors serving the Canadian market include:

* Coinsquare, a Toronto-based cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2014. Users can trade in a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Coinsquare has faced regulatory challenges in the past but has since taken steps to improve its compliance practices.

* Shakepay, a Montreal-based cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to trade in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The exchange has a reputation for its user-friendly interface and fast transaction times.

* Binance, a global cryptocurrency exchange that has had a strong presence in Canada. The exchange offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies and has a reputation for low trading fees. However, Binance has faced regulatory challenges in some jurisdictions (notably, Binance issued a decision in June 2021 to quit Ontario, as a result of an OSC compliance ruling.)

* Kraken, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange that has a significant presence in the Canadian market. The exchange allows users to trade in a range of cryptocurrencies and offers advanced trading features for more experienced traders. Kraken has a reputation for its security and has never suffered a significant security breach.

In addition to these domestic and foreign competitors, there are also peer-to-peer exchanges such as LocalBitcoins and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap that are available to Canadian users. These exchanges allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized exchange.

## Public perception

The perception of cryptocurrency exchanges has been damaged in the past by prominent hacks and scandals (notably Mt. GOX, which was subject to security breaches) and FTX/Alameda (which was a massive fraud scheme) which resulted in lost customer funds and loss of trust in the industry. This raised the bar for NDAX to be perceived as a safe, secure and properly-regulated place for Canadians to invest.

NDAX has implemented several security measures to protect customer funds. These include multi-signature wallets, two-factor authentication (2FA), and cold storage for the majority of customer funds. NDAX has also partnered with world-class security firms to perform regular security audits and ensure the safety of their platform.

Due to their efforts to prioritize security and compliance, NDAX has gained a reputation as a reliable and trustworthy cryptocurrency exchange in Canada. This has resulted in a growing customer base and increased trading volume on their platform. NDAX has also been recognized for their efforts, receiving awards such as the 2019 Start Alberta Award for Innovative Business of the Year.

## Regulatory challenges

One of the most significant challenges NDAX faced in order to operate in Canada was navigating the complex regulatory environment surrounding financial institutions. The company had to register with FINTRAC and comply with strict anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. NDAX also had to become a member of the Canadian Money Services Businesses (MSB) Association, obligating them to follow a strict code of conduct.

NDAX invested heavily in compliance and regulatory technology. They implemented strict KYC and AML procedures to ensure that their platform was secure and compliant with Canadian regulations.

## Technical challenges

NDAX needed to invest in their trading platform infrastructure. A number of components had to be developed:

* Trading engine: NDAX uses a proprietary matching engine designed to handle high volumes of trading activity with low latency. The engine is based on a distributed architecture, which helps to ensure that the platform can handle large spikes in trading volume with low latency.

* APIs: NDAX provides a comprehensive set of APIs that allow developers to integrate the exchange's trading functionality into their own applications. The APIs support a range of programming languages, including Python, Java, and Node.js.

* Funds transfer infrastructure: Because NDAX is fully registered with FINTRAC, it is allowed to let users deposit and withdraw funds in CAD via common bank transfers, as well as international SWIFT wire fransfers.

* Blockchain Interface: NDAX interfaces with blockchains using a range of technologies, including APIs and node software. The exchange supports a range of networks including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Cardano (Binance Chain is notably absent).

* Security Technologies: NDAX uses a range of measures to protect its users' assets and data. These include multi-factor authentication, encrypted communication channels, and cold storage for customer funds.

* Compliance: NDAX has implemented infrastructure to ensure that its platform is compliant with Canadian regulations. These include automated KYC and AML checks, transaction monitoring, and reporting tools.

## Revenue model

NDAX generates revenue through trading fees, which are charged to users when they buy or sell cryptocurrencies on the platform. It has a rewards program to incentivize trading on its platform.

NDAX charges listing fees to issuers of new cryptocurrencies.

In addition, NDAX also generates revenue through its OTC trading desk, which allows users to trade large volumes of cryptocurrencies outside of the regular order book. The OTC trading desk charges a fee for its services, which is negotiated on a case-by-case basis.

NDAX has also introduced value-added services such as NDAX Academy (an educational program).

## Performance metrics

* Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): This metric measures how much it costs to acquire a new customer. This includes marketing and sales expenses, as well as other related costs.

* Customer Retention Rate (CRR): This metric measures how well a company is retaining its customers. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers retained by the total number of customers, expressed as a percentage.

* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): This metric measures the average amount of revenue generated by each user. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of users.

* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): This metric is commonly used by subscription-based Fintech companies to measure the total amount of revenue they are expected to receive each month from their customers.
* Churn Rate: This metric measures the rate at which customers are leaving a company. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers lost by the total number of customers, expressed as a percentage.

* Gross Margin: This metric measures how much profit a company is generating from its revenue. It is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the revenue and dividing by revenue, expressed as a percentage.

* Cash Burn Rate: This metric measures how quickly a company is spending its available cash. It is calculated by dividing the net cash used in operating activities by the number of months, quarters, or years.

* Return on Investment (ROI): This metric measures the return a company is generating on its investments. It is calculated by dividing the net profit by the total investment, expressed as a percentage.

* Net Promoter Score (NPS): This metric measures the likelihood that a customer would recommend a company to others. It is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?


## Outlook

As of 2023 and going forward, there is likely to be increasing demand for cryptocurrency trading in Canada. In a bullish economic forecast, NDAX is likely to see increased trading volumes as more investors look to invest in cryptocurrencies. In a bearish forecast, NDAX may see a decrease in trading volumes and potentially a decline in revenue. However, barring any unforeseen breach, public relations disaster, or drastic change in government regulations, the outlook for NDAX appears positive for 2023 and beyond.
